# A simple hangman game programmed in Python 3
#
# You need to have Python 3 installed on your system to be able to run this game.
# Tested on Python 3.3.2.
#
# The game prompts the user to enter a letter to start guessing a word.
# 11 incorrect guesses are allowed, after the 11th, hangman is hanged and the game is over.
# You can enable/disable audio output (see output function)
#
# TODO
# - retrieve words from a Wikipedia page
# - build hangman (ASCII graphics)
# - transform umlauts (Ã¼ -> ue)
# - delay for say? (so as to display text earlier)
# - switch between EN and DE words (dict file) ... parameters!
# - hint system (which letter is likely to be part of the word)
# - alternatives for say for other platforms (linux, windows)
# - AI
# - put licence into comments (check underscore blahfoo)
#
# Further ideas:
# - let user guess the entire word
# - allow phrases and words with hyphens
# - multiplayer hangman
