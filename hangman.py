# A simple hangman game programmed in Python 3
#
# You need to have Python 3 installed on your system to be able to run this game.
# Tested on Python 3.3.2.
#
# The game prompts the user to enter a letter to start guessing a word.
# 11 incorrect guesses are allowed, after the 11th, hangman is hanged and the game is over.
# 
# Features/checks already implemented
# - only letters are allowed (no digits, no special characters)
# - a letter can't be guessed more than once (i.e. only counts toward incorrect guesses once)
# - incorrectly guessed letters are continuously displayed (correct guesses are part of word anyway)
# - words can contain uppercase and lowercase letters
#
# TODO
# - retrieve words-to-be-guessed from a file (with minimum length of e.g. 5 letters/word)
# - build hangman (ASCII graphics)
# - differentiate between plural & singular form for tries left (5 tries vs. 1 try)
# - adjust countdown of incorrect guesses (currently counts down from 10 to 0)
# - rearrange print statements (reduce lines)
# - output everything with say (= sound)
# - add more comments!
#
# Ideas for additional/advanced Nice To Have's
# - let user guess the entire word
