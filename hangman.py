# A simple hangman game in Python

# Additional features
#
# DONE
# - warning if there's non-letter input
# - warning if letter was already previously guessed
#
# TODO
# 
# - get words-to-be-guessed from a file
# - hangman (graphics)
# - correct guesses needn't be in list of all guesses
# - letter matching should ignore upper/lowercase
