# Misc. Python programs & games
### Spielend Programmieren

A few small Python programs/games developed during the summer of 2013 as part of the course work at/for [Spielend Programmieren](http://www.spielend-programmieren.at).

All programs were written in Python 3 (tested on 3.3.2) and are very likely - or, in some cases, definitely - not compatible with Python 2. Sorry! :/


## Hangman
A simple (but ever more evolving) game of hangman.

Note: You need to have Python 3 installed on your system to be able to run this game. (Tested on Python 3.3.2.)

The game prompts the user to enter a letter to start guessing a word.<br>
11 incorrect guesses are allowed, after the 11th, hangman is hanged and the game is over.<br>
