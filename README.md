# Hangman
### A Hangman game programmed in Python.

My very first Python program as well as my first game. Developed during the summer of 2013 as part of the course work at/for [Spielend Programmieren](http://www.spielend-programmieren.at). Originally written in Python 3, now also backward compatible with 2.6+. Tested on Python 3.3.2 and 2.7.

__Notes:__<br>
You need to have Python 2.6+ installed to run this game.<br>
The game's objective is to guess a word, letter by letter.<br>
11 incorrect guesses are possible, then hangman dies and the game is over.

__Parameters__ the game can be run with:
* -nosound to turn off text-to-speech
* -en|de to play with English or German words
<br>
<br>

__WIP (13-07-25)__<br>
Currently working on making the game playable on different devices with [Kivy](http://kivy.org/).
