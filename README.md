# Misc. Python programs & games
### Spielend Programmieren

A few small Python programs/games developed during the summer of 2013 as part of the course work at/for [Spielend Programmieren](http://www.spielend-programmieren.at).

All programs were written in Python 3 (tested on 3.3.2) and are very likely - or, in some cases, definitely - not compatible with Python 2. Sorry! :/


## Hangman
A Hangman game programmed in Python 3.

__Notes:__<br>
You need to have Python 3.x installed to run this game.<br>
The game's objective is to guess a word, letter by letter.<br>
11 incorrect guesses are possible, then hangman dies and the game is over.<br>

__Parameters__ the game can be run with:
* -nosound to turn off text-to-speech
* -en|de to play with English or German words
