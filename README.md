# Hangman
### A Hangman game programmed in Python 3.

My very first Python program as well as my first game. Developed during the summer of 2013 as part of the course work at/for [Spielend Programmieren](http://www.spielend-programmieren.at), written in Python 3 (tested on 3.3.2).

In its current form, the game does not work with Python 2.<br>
I am, however, planning to make it compatible with Python 2.6+.

__Notes:__<br>
You need to have Python 3.x installed to run this game.<br>
The game's objective is to guess a word, letter by letter.<br>
11 incorrect guesses are possible, then hangman dies and the game is over.

__Parameters__ the game can be run with:
* -nosound to turn off text-to-speech
* -en|de to play with English or German words


Status 13-07-25__<br>
__WIP__ Currently working on making the game playable on different devices with [Kivy](http://kivy.org/).
